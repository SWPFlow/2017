# Abstract

> With 313 million active users and approximately 500 million Tweets sent per day, Twitter has plenty of low-hanging fruit ripe for OSINT picking. Learn from an experienced information professional how to craft advanced searches to retrieve data from this popular social media platform. Understand the search commands that Twitter uses, tips and techniques for extracting data, examine some of the lesser-known features of Twitter, and get a glimpse of some of the resources that work in conjunction with Twitter to help you better organize all the information you will retrieve. 

> While you may know how to write scripts and scrape data from Twitter, this session will focus on the GUI which can retrieve much older data. This session is not how to Tweet better, get more likes, or even how to get verified. This is all about searching for and extracting information from Twitter and its associated sites. You will come away from this session with a better understanding of how to use Twitter as a research tool.
