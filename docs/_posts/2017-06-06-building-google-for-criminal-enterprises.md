# Abstract

> I was able to create a proof of concept application that scrubs a recreation of the Ohio Voter Database, which includes first name, last name, date of birth, home address, and link each entry confidently to its real owners Facebook page. By doing this I have created a method by which you can use the Voter Database to seed you with name address and DOB, and Facebook to hydrate that information with personal information. 

> My application was able to positively link a voter record to a Facebook account approximately 45% of the time. Extrapolated that out over the 6.5 million records in my database and you get 2.86 million Ohio resident Facebook records
