# Abstract

> In this talk I will give a brief introduction to phonetic algorithms and how they can apply to searching through social media data and other domains. I will then demonstrate applying these techniques to a US Census dataset, and generate a searchable dataset capable of suggesting alternative spellings and pronunciations of names. I will finish by talking about how we can detect potentially malicious domains using these techniques.
