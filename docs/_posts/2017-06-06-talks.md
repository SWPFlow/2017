We are pleased to announce the list of selected talks for Recon Village. 

### Keynote: It’s Going To Get Worse Before It Gets Better - The Future of Recon Data Mining
by *[@tactical_intel](https://twitter.com/tactical_intel)*

The OSINT and reconnaissance landscape is beginning to face some challenges. Current valuable sources such as open sourced lists are already facing offensive and malicious data poisoning. Privacy laws are creating barriers in many areas, and as court rulings are levying increasing fines for playing fast and loose with user data privacy. Social media companies are starting to realize that they actually need to start making profits, and are restricting their data. 

Sites are aggressively combating web crawling, services like TOR and VPN face uncertain futures, the list of potential hurdles to the future of OSINT and recon seems grim. But fear not. There is still hope - and plenty of it. This presentation will discuss both the challenges and changes to both offensive and defensive reconnaissance that the presenter believes we will see in the future, and strategies that will help mitigate or enhance these changes.

### Building Google For Criminal Enterprises
by *[@DotNetRussell](https://twitter.com/DotNetRussell)*

<b>Talk Category:</b> Live Demo

I was able to create a proof of concept application that scrubs a recreation of the Ohio Voter Database, which includes first name, last name, date of birth, home address, and link each entry confidently to its real owners Facebook page. By doing this I have created a method by which you can use the Voter Database to seed you with name address and DOB, and Facebook to hydrate that information with personal information. 

My application was able to positively link a voter record to a Facebook account approximately 45% of the time...

### FERPA: Only Your Grades Are Safe; OSINT In Higher Education
by *[@Sweet_Grrl](https://twitter.com/Sweet_Grrl)*

<b>Talk Category:</b> Comprehensive

Institutions of higher education are supposed to be somewhere that students go, earn a degree, and leave, all while their data is safe. Or is it? In this talk, I discuss the gaping security holes left by FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) with regard to student data. 

Almost all student data, with the exception of grades and select demographics picked by each institution, are commonly listed as directory information that is available to anyone who asks. Add to this most institutions of higher education commonly practice automatic “opt-in” for Directory Information and require students to specifically request that their information be withheld. This leads to an OSINT opportunity ripe for abuse...

### How to obtain 100 Facebooks accounts per day through internet searches
by *[@bym0m0](https://twitter.com/bym0m0)*

<b>Talk Category:</b> Lightening

Back in 2016, it was very new the way how the Facebook mobile application implements content through ““Instant articles””. A user can view content from third parties directly in the Facebook platform without requiring to open the Browser, for instance. This content can also be shared, saved, opened in browser and so on.

In this talk, we will share how this Instant articles, and the way the were shared, lead us to the possibility to access Facebook accounts and how through internet searches this became a huge problem! We’ll discuss how we identify the issue and how it was tested, reported, fixed, rewarded and also we talk about a new vector attack for further research...

### OSINT Tactics on Source Code & Developers
by *[@simonroses](https://twitter.com/simonroses)*

<b>Talk Category:</b> Comprehensive

This practical talk is about using OSINT techniques and tools to obtain intelligence from source code. By analyzing the source code, we will profile developers in social networks to see what social networks they use, what they are saying, who they follow, what they like and much more data about them.

We will use well-known tools and custom Python scripts to automatize the parsing of source code, analyzing comments for behavior and sentiments, searching for OSINT patterns in code and fingerprinting developers in social networks, among other things. The collected data will be plotted in different visualizations to make the understanding of information easier...

### Recon and bug bounties - What a great love story!
by *[@abhijeth](https://twitter.com/abhijeth)*

<b>Talk Category:</b> Live Demo

Recon is an important phase in Penetration Testing. But wait, not everyone does that because everyone’s busy filling forms with values. Effective recon can often give you access to assets/boxes that are less commonly found by regular penetration testers.

In this talk, the speaker will demonstrate few effective techniques using which researchers/pen testers can do better information gathering. The speaker would also share many stories which allowed him to earn some bounties using these recon techniques. This techniques might also be useful to red teams/incident response teams to identify rogue devices in their organisation which are often missed out during normal penetration testing...

### Skip tracing for fun and profit
by *[@greenhagen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greenhagen/)*

<b>Talk Category:</b> Comprehensive

This talk covers skip tracing TTPs and countermeasures in the digital and human domains. The audience will be guided through two real world examples of how a regular citizen can use open source tools, exploits, and social engineering to assist law enforcement and profit.

Some examples include phishing websites tailored to a fugitive’s resume, geolocating a target through video game clients, and using social media meta-data to build pattern-of-life. As the audience is moved through the process step by step, online and offline countermeasure such as USPS forwarding, false resume writing, and secure communications will also be covered...

### Total Recoll: Conducting Investigations without Missing a Thing
by *[@jerkota](https://twitter.com/jerkota)*

<b>Talk Category:</b> Lightening

Recoll is a free and open source desktop tool which allows you to search through any arbitrary documents - but it can do more. By using the Recoll web indexer, you can automatically save a copy of any web sites you visit, and search them as well. This combination makes Recoll a great “capture and search” tool for investigators. 

This talk will demonstrate what Recoll can do for you using two case studies - searching through a trove of leaked NSA documents and conducting an OSINT investigation online...

### Using DFIR Orchestration and Automation Tools and Playbooks For OSINT and Recon
by *[@physchosis](https://twitter.com/physchosis)*

<b>Talk Category:</b> Live Demo

Everyone has probably heard about orchestration and automation tools in DFIR but what if we took the same concepts from DFIR and apply that to OSINT? In this talk we will discuss how to use DFIR tools and concepts for reconnaissance, investigations, and OSINT data gathering. We will work through an automated playbook to gather evidence on things like domains, organizations and people, then discuss using integrations like Intrigue.io, Pipl, DataSploit, and more all in parallel and finally wrapping up by storing the evidence, contacting, liberating and helping others by responding with the evidence, or simply just having some fun...
