# Abstract

> This practical talk is about using OSINT techniques and tools to obtain intelligence from source code. By analyzing the source code, we will profile developers in social networks to see what social networks they use, what they are saying, who they follow, what they like and much more data about them.  

> We will use well-known tools and custom Python scripts to automatize the parsing of source code, analyzing comments for behavior and sentiments, searching for OSINT patterns in code and fingerprinting developers in social networks, among other things. The collected data will be plotted in different visualizations to make the understanding of information easier.  

> The objective of the talk is to introduce attendees into OSINT tactics they can use to collect and analyze data, use the right tools and automatize tasks with Python scripting. For this example we have targeted developers and their projects. 

> Come and learn some OSINT tricks you can apply to collect and analyze data!
